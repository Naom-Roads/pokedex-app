#219ebc Light Blue
#023047 Dark Blue
#ffb703 Mustard Yellow
#fb8500 Tangerine Orange

# Phase 1 (Complete)

* Built main html page that displays all pokemon on a list
* Indivual Pokemon can be clicked on to display stats 
* Used vanilla JS to pull information from the API then minified to ensure  it's not too resource intensive. 
* Added bootstrap and some custom styles so that it had the responsiveness and accesibility that comes with bootstraps features but still had a personal touch so that it looks unique in comparison to basic bootstrap modules. 
* Checked and cleared all errors using eslint and w3C validator. Tested on other browers and using different Explorer, Chrome and Edge, also tested on different size devices using different network speeds. App worked as expected and didn't lag for too long on slower internet speeds.  



# Phase 2 (TBD)

* Add Pagination - Currently app loads 150 Pokemon instances at a time. It would be better if we loaded fewer pokemon and allowed the user to go to another page to load more 

* Add Search, it appears that this has not been added to the API documentation but there might be a way to create a function that compares the ids with the pokemon.name entered in the search. It would be limited but would be an great feature update as there are hundreds of pokemon and being able to search would greatly improve user experience. (DONE)
